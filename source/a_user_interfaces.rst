Introduction
============

Lizard is a data and analytics platform, optimised for the physical environment.
We enable you to unlock the potential of your data and allow you to integrate and combine data from different sources and domains.
Explore your data with plug-and-play applications.
Or connect your favourite data science tools with our API. 

The documentation has detailed descriptions of individual components of every aspect of Lizard.
Feel free to move through every section in sequence by using the next functionality at the bottom of every page, or dive straight to the item of interest with the use of the left pane.
