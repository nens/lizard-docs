Explore your data with plug-and-play applications.
Or connect your favourite data science tools with our API. 


The documentation will guide you through all the possibilities of Lizard.
It contains step-by-step tutorials for users that want to explore their data using the Lizard Viewer, Lizard Dashboards and Lizard Atlases. 
Data managers can find an extensive description for data exchange and management possibilities. 
(Geo)data scientists can find interactive jupyter Notebooks with tutorials (in various levels of complexity) that explain how Lizard can be used in timeseries and geodata analysis.
