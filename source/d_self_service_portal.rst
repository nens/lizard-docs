All incidents relating to the Lizard software with the exception of enhancement/feature requests are recorded and followed up at no additional cost. 

Priority incidents
==================

The responsiveness of Nelen & Schuurmans is driven by the severity of an incident.
All incidents within the agreement can be subdivided into priorities.
There are three levels here.
Each level is based on an urgency.
The initiative for determining urgency lies primarily with the applicant.
The levels are:

* **Prio 1 (high):** Lizard functionality is completely unavailable or inaccessible. The situation requires immediate attention. The work and/or management processes are hindered or the importance to the Client is large with no workaround possible.
* **Prio 2 (medium):** The work and/or control processes are hindered or the Client's importance is large, but a workaround is possible.
* **Prio 3 (low):** Not urgent. Lizard is impaired, a single function is impacted but key business processes are not interrupted. The problem causes minimal operational or business impact, a general technical question or enhancement request.


Feature requests
================
Beyond the scope are enhancement/feature requests or questions about the use of Lizard in the organisation,
for which the customer can purchase an additional service.
For more info the customer can contact the local Lizard consultant or email to info@nelen-schuurmans.nl.
