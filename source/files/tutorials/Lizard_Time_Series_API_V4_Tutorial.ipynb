    "# Getting familiair with Lizard Time Series API V4\n",
    "Welcome! In this Notebook we will help you get more familiair with time series and their availability through the Lizard Time Series API.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Lizard is a cloud-based datawarehouse & analytics platform for data that describes the physical environment.\n",
    "The Lizard Time Series server stores time series data, which for example can describe the water level in a river or the energy consumption of a pumping station.\n",
    "Time series in Lizard are always related to a geographical location (x,y).\n",
    "In addition time series can be linked to an asset.\n",
    "More general information surrounding time series in Lizard can be found in the documentation: https://docs.lizard.net/c_timeseries.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Lizard offers a high-performance, easy to access data source with its API.\n",
    "The API can be used to retrieve raw data or for to retrieve aggregated data and statistics.\n",
    "There is a wide variety of use cases, this notebook will help you get familiar with requesting time series data from the Lizard API."
