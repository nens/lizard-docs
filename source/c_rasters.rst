Rasters

The data management interface for rasters can be used to upload, edit or remove rasters.
Raster Sources are the data containers, Raster Layers are the configuration of how the data is visualised.

Creating and editing Raster Sources and Layers
----------------------------------------------

The first step in uploading your raster datasets is to create a Raster Source.

The Data Management interface is available at: “www.{your_organisation}.lizard.net/management/”.

After landing on this page, click on ‘Data’ -> ‘Rasters’ -> 'Raster Sources'.
Click on “New Item” |NewItem| to open the form or choose an existing raster to edit.

After filling in the form you can choose to directly upload your data by selecting your GeoTIFF's in the 'Data' section.
In case of a temporal raster source you need to specify which file belongs to which timestep.
This is recognised automatically if the filename is built up according to the specified format.
When you save a new Source you will have the option to go straight to the Raster Layer form to publish your data.
