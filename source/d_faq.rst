How do I get access to an organisation?
---------------------------------------

Before rights were granted through the servicedesk. 
However, we have opted for a new system where the organisations themself grant rights to users.
This way they are totally aware and in control of who has access to their data.

To be able to access the data of an organisation you have to ask permission to one of the organisations Managers.
These have the ability to give you the permissions required.
