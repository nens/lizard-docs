API tutorials
==============================

We created interactive manuals for data scientists to use the Lizard API. 
At the moment we have the following 3:




1. Interactive Time Series API manual 
--------------------------------------

| `Notebook for api/v4/timeseries <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VnwgAJQ-bSq2nsyAjaS43xm6noyfcTEc#scrollTo=FQ79duRxpTFt>`_



2. Interactive Rasters API manual 
------------------------------------

| `Notebook for /api/v4/rasters <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m9ECiz_mkkMWdxksAOUReOMHK4X7u-bH>`_


3. 3Di scenario download
--------------------------

| `Notebook for how to download a maximum waterdepth raster from a 3Di-scenario <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lW5QYenED5OvAGa93J8LTlM4Ox85lpli#scrollTo=IQFuyCScVAF1>`_



.. topic:: Jupyter notebook

    Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows to share Python documents that contain live code, equations, visualisations and
    narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualisation, machine
    learning, and much more. You can run the code in the browser, but you can also copy the code to your own programming app.



.. note::
	API v4 is the experimental API version. API v3 is our stable version. We will revision the tutorials after a release.
