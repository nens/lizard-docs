Welcome to the Lizard documentation!
####################################

Lizard is a datawarehouse and analysis platform for data on water, climate, and the physical environment. Lizard brings data together from different sources and makes it searchable and available for integrated use and further analysis. 
Lizard can be used to view the spatial and temporal information in the user interface. 
In addition, Lizard is used by data scientists and engineers to support their organization with data science using API connections.

This documentation helps users to get familiar with the user interface and all other components of Lizard. Feel free to move through every section in sequence by using the next functionality at the bottom of every page, or dive straight to the item of interest with the use of the left pane. 

**If you are new to Lizard, we recommend the following pages:**

**If you want to know more about supplying or retrieving data:**

- :ref:`API introduction <api_intro_ref>`
